# PacManExcersize
The PacManExcersize was to understand how you could pass parameters to functions by value.
We also learned how scope impacts variables within a function.
This program also displays multiple if then statements.
We applied these skills by creating a Pac-Man that opens and closes its mouth and changes direction on screen.
